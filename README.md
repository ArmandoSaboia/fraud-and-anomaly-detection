## Introduction
This project aims to develop a comprehensive Fraud and Anomaly Detection System using Python and Machine Learning. The system leverages various data preprocessing techniques, machine learning models, interactive visualizations, and a user-friendly Streamlit app to identify fraudulent credit card transactions and visualize anomalies.

## Project Overview
- **Data Loading and Exploration:** Load and explore the credit card transaction dataset. Visualize the class distribution of transactions.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handle missing values and standardize selected features.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Analyze the distribution of transaction amounts and visualize patterns using histograms and box plots.
- **Model Development with PyCaret:** Develop an Isolation Forest model for anomaly detection using the PyCaret library.
- **Interactive Visualization with Mito:** Utilize Mito for creating interactive visualizations to gain insights from the data.
- **Streamlit Application:** Build a user-friendly Streamlit app for users to interact with the data and view anomaly detection results.
- **Presentation and Documentation:** Create a comprehensive presentation and documentation outlining the project steps, findings, and usage instructions.

## Steps
Each step of the project is meticulously executed and documented. The code and detailed explanations can be found in the [Python code](https://github.com/yourusername/fraud-anomaly-detection/blob/main/fraud_detection.py) file.
